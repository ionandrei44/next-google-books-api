## Web Operations Development Coding Challenge

Starting from this template, you will need to implement the following tasks:

- Connect to the Google Books API to search for books (https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes)

- Type in a query and display a list of 5 books matching that query.

- Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company.

- A user should be able to select a book from the five displayed to save to a “Reading List”
  
- View a “Reading List” with all the books the user has selected from their queries -- this is a local reading list and not tied to Google Books’s account features.

Also, it's very important to use Next 14 App Router, Server Components, TailwindCSS and TypeScript.
